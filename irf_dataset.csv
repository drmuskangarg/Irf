Yesterday my girlfriend dumped me, it was genuinely sick, we had been dating almost 7 months and when she dumped me she laughed and smiled and treated me like shit. It was also my birthday. I loved this girl, I put in so much effort to be a person suited to society and not an overly cynical, disfunctional boyfriend in order for her to like me and so I could find happiness.

5,"Hi guys, Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous. Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3. In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..) I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business. I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this. I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago. It's been downhill ever since. Please help, happy to answer any more questions, and sorry if I've broken any rules; I'm new to reddit.",0,,0,

I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself. But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage. Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.",1,feel empty,0,

I've dragged down those who are closest to me, because maybe they know, but I've never felt so grateful towards anyone for merely existing near me. I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically. I'm still far from escaping this pit, but were it not for moments like those, I'd have stopped this nonsense a long while ago. It's made me appreciate things that I've never cared about, even if moments where I truly smile are few and far in between.

I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in. And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad.

My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole. People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore. Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything. I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically. I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed.

That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends.

Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that.

Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear. i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better. however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances). I have to change the way my mind works and honestly, it seems impossible. any thoughts/help/advice?",1,0 self worth,0,

Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing. Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore. I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly. Heck, I've been putting off this post for months now and I stopped halfway my stream of conciousness because there are far more serious problems to discuss about here than some indecision, burn-out and post-breakup trauma.

On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work.

The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout.

We tried celexa again- didn't work. wasn't anything like the first time. then put me on wellbutrin- didn't really work either. then we finally tried effexor- same deal, didn't notice any positive changes.

I do not have much money as I am currently a college student. I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help.

It's very hard to describe. See, I recently turned 18. I'm graduating high school a semester early with a fairly low GPA (2.7 weighted) despite my myriad veritable academic interests because I have this overwhelming boredom and this feeling that nothing is happening when I'm there. This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life. I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve? I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve.

Life has evolved over millions of years to adapt to anything that mother nature threw at us, and here we are, humans, in all our glory and achievements, still scaling new heights. What do we live for? Different individuals will give you different answers, but the top dogs in history came into power for reasons that boils down to one thing, immortality. And no, not literal immortality, rather, to immortalize their name in the books after they've passed on. We all fear death, but what we fear more is to be completely forgotten. If that is the case, then our rat race, arms race and hardwork all comes to naught in the face of entropy. It's far from now, astronomically far, but know that the universe will tear itself apart one day, not even subatomic particles will be there. This, this is a fate worse than death. All life, heck, even inorganic matter will be pulled apart. So why are we trying so hard to leave a mark in history if nothing matters in the end? Love, life, hope, dreams... It all doesn't matter. No wonder people want to believe in religion, to escape thos nihilistic despair. But hey, this is just science, and science is as good as human ingenuity and observation.

Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for. I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events. How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me? I guess I'll try to answer for myself. I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose. Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough. I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess. I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard. Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first. As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate. The real struggle is to create something more. I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree.

Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never sure until now. And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do. Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse. And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again..

What's worse, it marks another year during which I was totally miserable. Every New Year's Eve, I am made to reflect that I felt just as bad over the last year as I did the year before, often worse. I don't feel any better about anything in my life after a whole year having passed. Every year I tell myself that I am trying harder than I ever have to be better, and that there is some prospect that in the next year there will be something in my life that makes it worth living, that takes a little bit of the pain away.

It's 5 am. You just took a double dose of melatonin followed by a few gulps of Nyquil just to try and get through the night. This time next year I want to be in a better place. Academically, spiritually, relationship wise. I want to be happy. If not I might just have to give up. So hello future me, I hope the next time you read this you'll be in a completely different place than you are right now. I hope you'll be a survivor ‚ù§",0,,1,thinking about dying
636,I know this sort of post isn‚Äôt original or whatever but here it is. It‚Äôs New Years Eve today where I am and honestly... I don‚Äôt think I could care any less. I‚Äôm so tired of pretending to give a shit about everything. About people about things about university and assignments. Mostly I‚Äôm tired of other people pretending to give a shit about me because they don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt. My family say they care yet constantly bombard me with all of their problems expecting me to have a magical solution. My friends are going through their own shit and whilst they try there‚Äôs nothing they can do for me. My girlfriend well... that‚Äôs something else entirely. I know she‚Äôs not happy. I know she‚Äôd rather not be with me. She‚Äôs been down this road before got the T shirt she shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with my bs too. I love her so much I don‚Äôt want to put her through this. But the issue is I can‚Äôt ever see myself getting better. It feels impossible. All I want to do everyday is stay in bed. I want to sleep all of the time. Half the time I‚Äôm not even physically tired I just... everything is too much effort. I can‚Äôt win. I really can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been trying for years but it never gets better. Not for people like me. We‚Äôre destined to suffer and bleed and cry forever. What sort of life is that? I don‚Äôt think I want to see the New Year.

At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor.

I of course didn't bring this up to my doctor and I am now wondering is it possible that the drugs used to self medicate might be causing alternative effects with the antidepressants?

753,"For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more. At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone. So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me... I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do.

Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone.

With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner. Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done.

I've realized I don't need my friends to go play an open Mic night, or go see a movie, or to go for a hike, in fact a lot of these are better done alone. 2017 my friends left me high and dry 2018 they're not gonna be able to",1,anti social,0,

Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight.

Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself.

Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent.

So why did I get cripplingly depressed all of a sudden? The brief period where I was exposed to just a little too much lead as a kid? When I fell on my head and got a crack in my skull at age 2? My parents don't eat that healthy and I didn't start eating right until my teens. I have psoriasis so technically I have an inflammatory disease. Is it one of these things??

It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves.

In the video, he speaks about all the suicidal messages he recieves from people all around the world who listen/watch him.

But, I just don't understand it. As much as I try to get it, I can't. Why do people weep for us? Why do they care so much? Why do they spend so much time and resources helping us get better?

Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out.

That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it?

It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them.

I don't care about my job, I am barely hanging on to my life in general. I am losing friends by the minute. Why the fuck does my life even matter? I just wish I had a gun, a rope, something, to end this misery. That's what I am right now, miserable. Not just now, for the past week, I have been miserable. But, the fact of the matter is, I don't want to get better anymore. The only way people know how treat me is to hospitalize me or IOP me or PHP me etc... These solutions clearly don't solve the problem. Maybe this is my farewell note to the world, I don't know. I just need an exit strategy that limits the fallout. I don't want to shoot myself because that's too nuclear. I wish there was a full proof way of OD'ing. That way my family (the last vestige of people who care) would be able to see me at peace.

But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen.""

I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain.

Whether thats true or not, I think I really need help with my life. I gotta feeling that I don't do anything good with my life. I am just wasting time on the internet to distract myself. I just want to know how to start to take action. I think I know excactly what I should do to become happy and to fix my life. I collected information, made daily tasks (which are totally possible to fulfill) and want to improve many aspects of my life, though i become overwhelmed. I don't even manage to stick to my healthy eating plan. So I end up doing nothing or just a few things and waste most of my time. I need to change something drastically. So my question is: is there any trick to start taking action? Any form of mind trick? How can I motivate myself? I just need to go through some days to see the improvement and then hopefully it gets easier, but I need a start...and at the moment I feel like I am stuck in this pot of laziness, vegetating.

There are so many people who'll say there's so much to live for or that it gets better. What if it doesn't?

I‚Äôm in university now, I do my work, get decent grades, but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. I don‚Äôt enjoy anything, my program is okay but I don‚Äôt see my future like so many people do. I struggle to make real connections with people, I am so emotionally unavailable and have hurt so many people leading them on and being unable to commit to them. I also barely enjoy sex and am traumatized from being sexually assaulted after a graduation party. I am wasting away my young adult years now, and soon enough I‚Äôll regret not doing anything with my time. Therapy has never worked for me. I can safely say that I am a ghost of who I was, and who I could‚Äôve been. I pretend and pretend but this part of me always seeps through the cracks. I want it to all end but I don‚Äôt think I could ever die, I am an only child and only daughter and it would tear my family apart. I‚Äôm just stuck.

I was struggling even when things were going well, but now I'm out of straws to grasp at. I don't like myself. I don't even respect myself. I'm embarrassed of the life I've lived. I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying. I like to say I won't make another attempt because of my dad, but some days I think the real reason is because I just haven't stockpiled enough pills yet. This is hard for me to type. I feel like I'm just an attention seeker. And, hey, maybe I am. I don't know. I don't even feel like I should be posting here. I'm not really an immediate threat to myself. I'm just desperate.

I work 50+ hrs and volunteer for the entire weekend. I have pets that need constant attention, and I'm constantly moving. When I'm not running around I always have a drink in hand. It works. The only time I look back is when I'm falling asleep, that's the worst. That's when I can't escape it. Thankfully sleep cones soon. But I need to keep moving. If I stop I'll be consumed. Im terrified of that. I can't handle that. I can't relive it, I just can't. I don't know what to do anymore. I come from a long line of alcoholics and I'm fast on my way to join them.

In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through.
