1505,"I don't see how it's supposed to help me feel or think any better. I already know that the way I think about things causes me to be depressed, but somehow I'm okay with it. It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either.

2980,I have been dating my bf for about 4 months so the relationship is fairly new. Yesterday we were supposed to hangout but he stood me up and texted at 11pm saying he overslept. He told me that we needed to talk about something tomorrow and when I asked if he could give me a topic just so I am not so worried he said it was about his depression. We have never discussed depression before however my ex also struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts throughout our 3yr relationship. I always did my best to be loving and supportive to my ex but I also felt like I didn‚Äôt know the best things to say.

774,"This is on wikipedia, the page title is ""Social psychology"". &gt; The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20] Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means. Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone.

735,"Hey guys, I'm hoping someone could shed some light on a situation for me. I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and an anxiety disorder. I have been suffering from.bith severe depression and severe anxiety for about 9 months and after trying numerous things to resolve it (including self medicating) I had finally decided to give medication a try. At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor. I recall before that episode had happened I had binged on counterfeit oxy and counterfeit Xanax (two pills I have been self medicating with as it's the only thing that helps me feel ""good""). I of course didn't bring this up to my doctor and I am now wondering is it possible that the drugs used to self medicate might be causing alternative effects with the antidepressants? The effexor seems to be a better fit for me as I didn't have many side effects but I still had a similar episode I had before. It all starts with a painful headache, then horrible thoughts and followed by uncontrollable anxiety that doesn't seem to die down. I remember I self medicated the second time in hopes it would stop the episode but that either didn't work or made it worse.

3218,"Been put back on antidepressants to help me with anxiety and depression. Also, short term benzo. Nothing is going right in life at the moment. And I've taken to hurting myself in anyway as much as possible. I have no control and alone in this, no one that actually wants to walk with me through this... Which, is the norm. And, I've done what I always do, which is cut everyone off, delete/deactivate everything, go to work with a mask on every day, crying myself to sleep every single night. Guess, knowing that I'm actually getting up and going to work is a good thing. As last time I just let everything go. I'm not as deep as I was back then, but I am still sinking right now. I've also had two panic attacks since. How long before the antidepressants begin to work typically?",1,alone in this,1,hurting myself
2085,"To be honest, I think I‚Äôm a low in my life.Im a junior in high school and I‚Äôm just praying that high school ends fast.Freshman year I came to a new school thinking that i would finally change my life of being friendless and alone. So,I made friends and it made me feel happier.But, each time i would burn a bridge with someone,I would always find myself coming back to them.During Sophomore year someone, who I considered my best friend , told me that my friends were fake.I held this friend to high regard and we left the friend group.And during Junior year , I had gained a solid group of friends that i felt actually liked me.But again this ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù had kept starting drama inside the group which caused me to have an angry outburst that ended my friendships.So now I‚Äôm here with only 2 friends and feeling alone.And in case you‚Äôre wondering, that ‚Äúfriend‚Äù had dropped me because i was having suicidal thoughts. So now I‚Äôm here.Nobody texts me,nobody tweets me, and nobody cares about me. I feel like I‚Äôm alone.I‚Äôll have good days but my mind will still be destroyed by pain.I don‚Äôt wanna feel this way anymore. I just wanna feel like I‚Äôm whole.Oh yeah, and also that friend outcasted me by telling multiple people about my suicidal thoughts and they look at me like I‚Äôm different.Despite the fact I have good grades,love to learn,and I‚Äôm ambitious, I still feel unhappy and want to have a solid group of friends that love me.I just wanted to share this because i wanna be able to type it out on some platform to maybe help someone and to use this as a way to tell myself that it will get better in college.",1,friendless,1,my suicidal thoughts
1764,"Hello, in need of some advise. I have a 2 year old greyhound who I have had for 1 year and I am thinking of giving him up. The reason for this is because of my lack of motivation due to my anxiety and depression. I never walk him because I can‚Äôt seem to make myself go out the house, I stay at home all day and it seems the only time I ever clean my house is when I have something to look forward which is another story but anyway due to not walking my dog he wees in my house and even poos sometimes, he is wrecking my house! He chews my carpets, eats anything in sight and I just can‚Äôt cope with him. I really do love him but he is ruining my life, I can‚Äôt even take him anyway because he destroys other people‚Äôs houses too. I think because he is a working dog he needs lots of walks to release his energy and because I don‚Äôt I think he is using that energy on ruining my house. I know I sound cruel but I really am depressed and I feel really bad for him:( I just need to know what would be the right thing to do, if I did get rid of him I would be very upset",1,cannot seem to make myself go out,0,

3363,"My father passed away last year. I feel incredibly alone now, he was my go-to person whenever I had a problem. I left my job to take some time off after he passed. I've left two more jobs since then, I just can't handle any of it any more. My gf, who I've been staying with, wants me to leave so she can ""find herself."" I can't blame her really. My father's gf, whom he was with at the time of his passing and for the previous 15 years or so, has already moved on and started dating a guy that I don't think dad would approve of, either. I don't know who to turn to or what to do. I have a little bit of money saved up so I'm not in immediate danger, and I think I've worked it out with my gf to stay here until I find a job? I just don't hold out a ton of hope. Whenever I think of getting another job, most likely in a field I hate anyway (recruiting), I just think ""what's the point?"" Like I really don't have a ton to live for at this juncture. I don't want it to be this way and I just can't seem to figure a way out of it that would give me a good quality of life. It all just feels pointless.
