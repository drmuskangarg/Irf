# Interpersonal Risk Factors in Reddit Posts
Due to the increasing number of social media posts that indicate suicidal risk and its severity, there is a need for more consequential and explainable research that can have an optimal impact on clinical psychology practice and personalized mental healthcare. Computational intelligence techniques have been successful in identifying mental illness through social media resources, particularly natural language processing, which can serve as a lens for determining Interpersonal Risk Factors (IRF) in human writings. However, limited availability of datasets for social NLP research has been a challenge for the community. To address this issue, we have constructed and released a new annotated dataset that includes human-labelled explanations and classification of IRF affecting mental disturbance on social media, specifically Thwarted Belongingness (TBe) and Perceived Burdensomeness (PBu). We have also established baseline models on our dataset, which can facilitate future research directions in developing real-time personalized AI models that can detect patterns of TBe and PBu in the emotional spectrum of a user's historical social media profile.
